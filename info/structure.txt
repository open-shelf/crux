Now for the business side, there are three stakeholders in the project development:

1. The content creator, author in this case
2. The readers who can pay for the book and stake only after purchasing it.
3. The platform which hosts all the books and do all the split of profits, etc

Now the project should use the following stack:
1. It must be built on Solana where the transaction happens using blinks.
2. Frontend must be built using react js
3. Anchor framework for Solana development
4. Use any storage services

The product must have two interfaces.
1. The content creator where they can post their chapters for a book. They can also see the number of people who bought it and similar statistics
2. The user or reader, who can select a book from a list of books. They can see the table of contents in the left side. They can start from whichever chapter they want to start from. When completing a chapter, the interface should show elegantly the next chapter has to be bought.
